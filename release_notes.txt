# COSPEDTree2 (or COSPEDBTree)
Improved COSPEDTree (Couplet based supertree) with much lower running time, and option for binary supertree generation.

Release details (starting from the latest release)
-----------------

                                                        Version 1.0 (18 August 2016)
                                                        -----------------------------

Completely upgraded code with the following modifications:

1) Dynamic frequency measure computation is finalized using the excess taxa count for individual couplets.
2) Binary refinement technique is completely changed, by using a reference Triplet based supertree construction 
method thSPR/thTBR (Lin et. al. 2009) applied on individual multifurcating nodes and its underlying taxa subsets.
3) The solution of the problem MPP is now upgraded by using the couplet based internode count measure.



                                                        Version 0.3 (30 August 2015)
                                                        -----------------------------

1) Weighted frequency measure, computed using the coverage of taxa underlying the LCA of individual couplets
this measure is now used as default
2) Priority measure for a couplet is updated to be the ratio of frequencies
3) We use number of queues as 1
4) NJ based method for binary refinement of the unresolved supertree now has 4 different versions:
    a) based on extra gene count between a couplet, computed for all the trees
    b) sum of branches between a couplet, computed for all the trees
    c) product of sum of branches and extra gene count
    d) product of coalescence rank and extra gene count

  In addition, we mention different computation of distance matrices (for NJ based refinement) according to the 
sum of values, average of values, or mode of values.


                                                        Version 0.2 (25 August 2015)
                                                        -----------------------------

Addition of features
---------------------
1) Updated binarization (of unresolved supertree) with NJ and extra gene count based resolving
2) Couplet based scores are dynamically updated according to the supertree created at each iteration.



                                                      Version 0.1 (17 June 2015)
                                                      ----------------------------

Contents
----------

1) Improved version of COSPEDTree with binary supertree generation, thus named as COSPEDBTree. 
It supports both non-binary and strict binary supertree.

2) Fastest among existing supertree approaches, with highly efficient supertree construction compared to the basic COSPEDTree approach. 
The performance (in terms of RF metrics) is kept identical for non-binary trees, between the earlier COSPEDTree and this package COSPEDBTree.


Future works
------------

1) For strict binary supertrees, as the source trees often are not complete binary, comparison leads to 
high number of false positive (FP) instances. We need to selectively make the tree binary (i.e. allow for 
some unresolved non-binary subtree in the supertree).
2) The code needs to be updated in terms of the comments, and names of few functions and variables.
3) The code needs to support Python 3.
4) The code needs to support Dendropy 4.0 (latest version).
5) The code needs to support execution on Windows XP and MacOS.
